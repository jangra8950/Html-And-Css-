     <p><b>Sachin Tendulkar</b> has been the <i> complete batsman of his time</i>,
          the <strong> prolific runmaker of all time</strong>,
          and arguably the <u>biggest cricket icon</u> the game has ever known.
           His <em> was based on the purest principles</em>: 
           perfect balance, <del> of movement</del>. 
           If he didn't have a signature stroke 
         - the <sup>upright </sup><sub>back-foot punch</sub> comes close 
         it's because he was equally proficient at each of the full range of shots 
          and can pull them out at will.
